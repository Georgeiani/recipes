    <h2>Ingredients needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>125g ball of mozzarella</li>
        <li>shaved parmesan</li>
        <li>cherry tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature.</li>
        <li>If you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li>heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
    </ol>
